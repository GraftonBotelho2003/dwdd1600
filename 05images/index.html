        <h1>Symbolic Realism Artwork</h1>
        <h2>Photographic Prints</h2>
        <p>Photographic prints are physical reproductions of images captured through photography. They are typically created by exposing <em>light-sensitive</em> paper or other materials to a negative or digital image and then developing the image using various chemical or digital processes. These prints can vary in size, texture, and finish, depending on the method and materials used. Photographic prints are often used for artistic, personal, or commercial purposes, serving as a tangible representation of a captured moment or scene.</p>

        <h2>Press Prints</h2>
        <p>Press prints refer to images or designs reproduced through printing presses, typically using techniques like offset, letterpress, or screen printing. This process involves transferring ink onto paper or other materials in large quantities, often for commercial purposes such as newspapers, magazines, posters, and books. Press prints are known for their efficiency and high-quality output, especially in mass production, and can feature sharp, vibrant images or text.</p>
