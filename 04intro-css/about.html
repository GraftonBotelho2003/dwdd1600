        <h1>About the Artist</h1>
        <h2>Life</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is <strong>Grafton Botelho</strong> I was born in Las Vegas, Nevada. Shortly after my parents moved us to Utah where I have lived ever since. I am curretnly studying graphic design at Utah Valley University and work at a cute print shop called Persnickety Prints. In my freetime I like to learn and grow as an artist. Focusing on family and friendship and all the relationships that come into my life allows for growth in multiple ways.</p>

        <h2>Why Art</h2>
        <p>Creating symbolic realism has been incredibly important to me because it allows me to express deeper emotions and ideas in a way that feels both personal and meaningful. By blending realistic imagery with symbolic elements, I can communicate complex themes that go beyond the surface, making my work more impactful. This style has been a useful resource in my life because it helps me process my own experiences, offering a way to reflect on emotions and moments that might otherwise be hard to articulate. It provides a unique lens through which I can explore and understand the world around me.</p>
