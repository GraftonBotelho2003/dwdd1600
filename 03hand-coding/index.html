        <h1>Symbolic Realism Artwork</h1>
        <h2>Photographic Prints</h2>
        <p>Photographic prints are physical reproductions of images captured through photography. They are typically created by exposing light-sensitive paper or other materials to a negative or digital image and then developing the image using various chemical or digital processes. These prints can vary in size, texture, and finish, depending on the method and materials used. Photographic prints are often used for artistic, personal, or commercial purposes, serving as a tangible representation of a captured moment or scene.</p>

        <h2>Press Prints</h2>
        <p>Press prints refer to images or designs reproduced through printing presses, typically using techniques like offset, letterpress, or screen printing. This process involves transferring ink onto paper or other materials in large quantities, often for commercial purposes such as newspapers, magazines, posters, and books. Press prints are known for their efficiency and high-quality output, especially in mass production, and can feature sharp, vibrant images or text.</p>

            <li><strong>canvas</strong></li>
            <p>Canvas prints are reproductions of images printed onto canvas fabric, offering a textured, artistic look. They are commonly used for fine art, photography, or decorative purposes, often stretched over a frame to create a gallery-style display. The canvas material gives the print a rich, tactile quality, making it a popular choice for home decor.</p>
            <li><strong>Giclee</strong></li>
            <p>Giclée prints are high-quality, inkjet reproductions of artwork or photographs, often on canvas or fine art paper. Known for their vivid colors and fine details, they are produced using archival inks that ensure long-lasting durability. Giclée prints are commonly used for limited edition art pieces.</p>
