        <h2>Life</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is <strong>Grafton Botelho</strong> I was born in Las Vegas, Nevada, but my family soon moved to Utah, where I've lived ever since. Growing up in Utah has shaped much of who I am today, and it's a place that's always felt like home. I am currently studying graphic design at Utah Valley University, where I'm honing my skills and learning more about the creative industry. In addition to my studies, I work at a charming print shop called Persnickety Prints, where I've gained invaluable experience in the world of design and printing. The work I do there has helped me grow professionally, but it's also enriched my personal appreciation for the craft. Outside of my work and academic pursuits, I'm passionate about dedicating my time to learning and growing as an artist. I always seek new ways to express myself creatively, whether through personal projects or exploring different mediums. I also place a lot of importance on family and friendships—the relationships I've built with those close to me provide constant support and inspiration. Focusing on these meaningful connections allows me to grow not only as an artist but also as an individual, helping me navigate the complexities of life and deepen my understanding of the world around me.</p>

        <h2>Why Art</h2>
        <p>Creating symbolic realism has been incredibly important to me because it offers a powerful way to express emotions and ideas that go beyond the surface. This style allows me to merge the familiar with the profound, blending realistic imagery with symbolic elements that carry deeper meanings. In doing so, I can communicate complex themes that touch on the nuances of human experience—those emotions and thoughts that are often difficult to express in words. By combining these elements, I create artwork that feels not only personal but also universally relatable, making it resonate with others on a deeper level. This style has been a vital resource in my life, as it gives me a channel to process my own experiences and reflect on moments that may otherwise be challenging to articulate. Through symbolic realism, I can explore my feelings, confront difficult situations, and find clarity. It provides a unique lens through which I not only understand myself but also interpret the world around me. Each piece becomes a journey of self-discovery, capturing emotions, stories, and messages that I might have otherwise overlooked. This process, though deeply personal, creates a connection to others who might find their own meaning in the symbols I use.</p>

        <h2>How Symbolic Realism Speaks To Me</h2>
        <p>Symbolic realism created with graphite and charcoal is a truly fascinating medium because it combines the precision and depth of realism with the rich, expressive potential of symbolism. Graphite allows for incredible detail and shading, bringing lifelike textures and forms to the forefront, while charcoal offers a dramatic, bold contrast that can evoke a sense of emotion and mystery. When these two mediums are used together, they create a dynamic tension between delicate, refined lines and deep, dark shadows. The subtle gradations of light and dark in graphite can convey intricate emotion and atmosphere, while charcoal's expressive strokes bring an intensity and rawness to symbolic imagery. This blend of technical skill and emotional depth allows for the creation of art that feels not only visually striking but also intellectually and emotionally profound. The monochromatic palette of graphite and charcoal also adds to the timeless quality of the work, inviting viewers to focus on the essence of the symbols and their meanings without being distracted by color. It's this balance between control and freedom, detail and abstraction, that makes symbolic realism in graphite and charcoal a truly captivating form of art.</p>
